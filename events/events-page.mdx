title: "The Events Page"
---

In your Settings page, you should see a section titled “Events”. On this page, you can view the entire event stream for your app. This includes events sent to us [via API](/add-users/api-reference) as well as [Zapier.](/add-users/zapier)

You can sort your events either by email, period of time or event name. You can even create complex segments to view events through a period of time by a single user.
