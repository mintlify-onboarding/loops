  Note: If you’re adding over 3,000 users at a time, let us know in Slack or
  over email (adam@loops.so). We can help speed up the process.

## Add new User’s via CSV

1. Select “Import users” in the top right of the [Audience](https://app.loops.so/audience/ckxj9uw97000509l1dhoxhk4p) page.

2. Download the example formatted CSV to get an idea of the columns we use. By default, we recommend using Email, First Name, Last Name, User Group and Source.

All users uploaded will be automatically marked as subscribed.

3. After uploading the CSV you’ll have a chance to review any duplicates or missing information before finishing.
4. When the upload is finished, all the uploaded users can be viewed in the Audience page. That’s it! 🎊
