## Creating a new Zap

To create a new Zap, say to connect Typeform and Loops, you’ll first need to follow the authorization instructions below. Then you’ll head over to the “create a zap” page and make sure you’re adding “Loops” as an “Action”.

In this case we’d want to make Typeform the Trigger and Loops the Action, which would send new Typeform submissions directly into Loops!
