## Default contact properties

These are the default properties for every contact on Loops. They cannot be deleted.

| Contact Property | Example                 | Merge Tag     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------- |
| Email            | hi@example.co           | `{email}`     |
| First Name       | Chris                   | `{firstName}` |
| Last Name        | Frantz                  | `{lastName}`  |
| Notes            | Favorite color is blue. | `{notes}`     |
| Source           | API                     | `{source}`    |
| Subscribed       | true                    | N/A           |
| User Group       | Investors               | `{userGroup}` |
| User Id          | ask523236               | `{userId}`    |

## Custom contact properties

Custom contact properties are additional fields that you can create to store information about contacts. You can create custom contact properties of type `string`, `number`, or `boolean` (Dates coming soon).

## Add a property

**Option 1**

To create a custom contact property visit [your Audience](http://localhost:3000/audience) and click on any of the column headers and select “Add property”:

**Option 2**

Alternatively, scroll to the end of the Audience table and click the **Plus** button at the end of the column headers.

Note that Loops does not allow properties with the following reserved names:

- `id`
- `listId`
- `softDeleteAt`
- `teamId`
- `updatedAt`

The same column header menu can be used to delete properties.

<Tip>

### Deleting contact properties

To delete a contact property, visit your [API Settings](http://localhost:3000/settings?page=api) page and click the trashcan icon next to contact property you’d like to delete.

Note that once a contact property is deleted, all associated data will also be deleted and cannot be recovered. It's important to be sure that you won't need the information stored in a property before deleting it.

**Property in use warning**

If you receive a “Property in use” warning modal while deleting a contact property, there are a few things you can check before you’re able to delete the property.

- If the listed email is a Campaign:
  - Check if the property is in use within a [Merge Tag](/creating-emails/personalizing-emails) inside the email editor
  - Ensure this property is not being actively used in the Audience filter
- If the listed email inside a Loop:
  - Make sure a draft or running Loop is not using it as part of the Audience filter or as a Trigger
