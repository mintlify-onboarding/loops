title: "Setting up a domain for sending with Loops"
---

When you set up your account for the first time, you will want to set up your domain records in order to start sending email.

Loops sends email on your behalf, using our IP’s. That means you get the benefit our shared IP reputation combined with the verified checkmarks in the inbox that shows you’re sending from your domain. Pretty cool right?

Here’s how to set it up in just a few steps.

## Step 1: Navigate to your domain settings page

Here’s a [quick link](https://app.loops.so/settings?page=domain). Click “View Domain Records”

## Step 2: Set up your records

On this page, you’ll see a few things.

1. **Your records**
   - These are SPF, DKIM and MX records that need to be set up in your domain zone editor inside of your domain registrar like Namecheap, Google Domains, AWS, Godaddy or elsewhere.
   - Next to each record is a tiny functional clipboard icon. You can use this to copy the records to your clipboard and paste them. More on this below!
2. **Your sending domain**
   - This is indicated below by “yourcompany.com”. This will have your domain listed. If you’d like to change domains, just contact Adam (adam@loops.so) and we’ll set up new records for you.
3. **A verify records button**
   - Once you have copied your records to your registrar, click this button to verify they have been set up correctly.

## Step 3: Add your domain records

Copy and paste the records over one by one into your registrar.

A few things to keep in mind:

- You want to use the “**TYPE**”, indicated as TXT, CNAME and MX in setting up your records, **_not_** the title of the record eg SPF, DKIM, MX
- Instructions for specific providers:

  Be sure to set the proxy to “DNS Only” for the CNAME records:

  If you are using the automatic Gmail/Gsuite integration with Namecheap, you will need to remove it then re-add your Gsuite records manually. [Here’s a guide](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33915?hl=en#zippy=%2Cstep-add-new-mx-records%2Cstep-verify-the-change-in-your-google-admin-console) (two steps) on how to complete this action.
    - If it appears you can only add a single record in the Custom MX options in Namecheap, that’s just poor UI. You can add multiple records.
