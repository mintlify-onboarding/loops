---

Gmail doesnâ€™t report spam reports to Loops, so setting up Google Postmaster is key to getting an idea of your deliverability performance in Gmail.

Google Postmaster is a free tool that provides users with in-depth data and analytics to help them understand how their emails are performing in Gmail.

This tool provides senders with data on various metrics such as spam rate, domain reputation, email authentication, and delivery errors. By analyzing these metrics, you can identify the issues that may be causing your emails to be marked as spam or not delivered.

You can signup for Google Postmaster here: https://gmail.com/postmaster/?utm_source=next.36kr.com
