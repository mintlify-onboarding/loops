During the Campaign sending process, you may see a notification if you haven't recently sent a campaign.

We have guardrails in place to protect our user's email deliverability (along with yours) and if you see this message, you're seeing one of those guardrails in action.

Emails will be monitored on send to ensure they're hitting the inbox. If you have any questions, contact us via any existing channel or send an email to support@loops.so
