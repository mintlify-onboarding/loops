## Introduction

Welcome to Loops, the platform for SaaS email.

With Loops, you can track events and contact properties and then use that information to send emails to increase revenue, engagement or just generally improve your user’s experience of your app.

Let’s get started ✨

## 0️⃣ Set up domain records

We send from your domain so your emails appear as if they’re coming from you.

Here’s an example of the emails we send. Your email won’t have any mention of Loops unless you’re on a free plan.

We choose to send from the `mail.loops.so` subdomain but you can send from your root domain if you’d prefer.

## Domain records

Before you can start sending emails with Loops, you need to set up your domain records. You can read this guide to [Setting up a domain for sending with Loops](https://www.notion.so/Setting-up-a-domain-for-sending-with-Loops-89c8293ca72243f0abda9c86d5fbbf2a) or figure it out yourself :)

You will be adding some DNS records to your domain's DNS settings so that we can verify that you own the domain you want to send emails from.

Once you've set up your domain records, you'll be able to start sending emails!

You can always send the records to a developer to help you integrate them. Here’s how: [Adding a member to your team](https://www.notion.so/Adding-a-member-to-your-team-616a99463eb2437c8aed8e38928f9637)

## 1️⃣ Import contacts

You can import users via @CSV Upload, @API or through one of our @Integrations .

<Tip>
  The most popular path is importing a CSV of existing contacts then using our
  API or an Integration to continue automatically adding contacts going forward.

### Contacts

Contacts are unique users in your Loop’s audience. We use email and a unique identifier to distinguish contacts. The only required field a contact must have is an email.

### Contact Properties

Contact properties are additional pieces of information you can associate with a contact. They can include things like name, location, job title, and more. You can use these properties to segment your audience and send more targeted emails to specific groups.

For example, you could send a promotional email only to contacts in a with a certain job title or in a certain user group.

## 2️⃣ Create your first email

To create your first email, first select the type of content you’ll be sending. You can send email as a campaign, loop or transactional email. You can also choose to start with a [Template](https://app.loops.so/templates) instead of starting from scratch.

### Campaigns

Manually sent emails, triggered by either you clicking send or scheduling a time for the email to send, is considered a campaign.

Campaigns are sent one time to a group of contacts you select.

**Examples**: newsletters, product updates, announcements, investor updates

### Loops

Loops are emails triggered by a contact joining your list, an update made to the contact’s property or an event sent via [API](https://www.notion.so/API-5b453a52dd7c4b419aa4647410de9770) or [Integrations](https://www.notion.so/Integrations-4599101e0010482b813f101767a9a03b). These are often known as “Lifecycle” emails.

Loops continue sending to the audience you have selected. By default, each contact receives a Loop one time.

**Examples**: onboarding a contact over a series of days, checking in when activity has dropped, encouraging usage of features based on other feature usage

### Transactional (in beta)

Transactional emails are emails that are required to be sent in order for the platform to continue to be used. They do not contain unsubscribe information as they must be received in order for contacts to continue using your platform.

**Examples:** forgot password, two-factor authorization codes, receipts

## 3️⃣ Metrics

Metrics are a key part of understanding the success of your email campaigns. Loops provides the following metrics to help you track the performance of your emails: open rates, click-through rates, unsubscribe rates, spam complaints, hard bounces and soft bounces.

You can use these metrics to make data-driven decisions about how to improve your emails and better engage with your audience.
