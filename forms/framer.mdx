## Embedding the component in Framer

3. Finally, paste the code copied in from Loops into the code editor. You should see the Preview on the right fill in with a preview of your component. Drag and drop your new asset anywhere on your page to use it :)

  Note: there is rate limiting, so you will get an error in testing if they
  submit more than once per minute or submit the same email twice.
