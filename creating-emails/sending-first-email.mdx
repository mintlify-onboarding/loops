title: "Sending your First Email"

## Best practices

- We have a “low-html” editor, which means your emails send with a minimal amount of styles applied. We do this so your emails are highly readable and so they’re more likely to not be placed in the spam folder or deprioritized in the inbox by your email provider.
- Try not to use sensational copy like “sale”, “discount” or exclamation points in your emails.
- It's also important to keep your emails short and to the point. Use an efficient subject line that encourages the reader to open the email and get to the point quickly in the body of the message.
- Use personalization when possible to make the message more engaging and relevant to the reader by [Personalizing your emails with merge tags ](/creating-emails/personalizing-emails)

## Send your first email

To send your first email, simply choose a template or start a new campaign/loop from scratch.

## Make your message visual

When you design an email with Loops, you can try adding instructive screenshots, GIFs, or images to create an engaging email.

- Drag and drop any image (including gifs!) into the editor
- Add links, buttons or dividers
- Style the email with the style panel in the title bar of the email editor (pictured below)

### Preview your email

Once you are happy with the design of your email, you can preview it. To preview your email, click the "Preview" button in the top right corner of the email editor to send a test email to yourself or anyone on your team.
