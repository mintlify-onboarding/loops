title: "Free Plan"
---

The Loops Free Plan is available to everyone who stores under 1,000 contacts on the Loops platform. After you’ve exceeded the 1,000 contact limit you’ll be prompted to upgrade to a paid plan.

You may also send up to 4,000 emails a month. That’s enough to email your entire audience every week!

Light branding will be placed at the bottom of your email (pictured below).

That’s it!
